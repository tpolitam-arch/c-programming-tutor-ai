# Unit 1: Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving

## History of Computers
- Evolution: mechanical → vacuum tubes → transistors → ICs → microprocessors.
- Generations of computers and their features.

## Basic Organization of Computer
- ALU, Input/Output units, Memory, Program Counter.
- Flow: Input → Processing → Output → Storage.

## Programming Basics
- Algorithms (step-by-step procedure).
- Flowcharts (use Dia tool).
- Pseudocode.

## Compilation & Execution
- Source → Compiler → Object Code → Executable.
- Errors: Syntax vs Logic vs Runtime.

## Data Types & Variables
- Primitive types: int, float, char, double.
- Constants, Type Casting, Conversion.

### Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    float b = 2.5;
    printf("Sum = %.2f", a+b);
    return 0;
}
```

### Practice Problems
1. Write a pseudocode to find the largest of 3 numbers.
2. Draw a flowchart to calculate factorial.
3. Write a C program to print ASCII value of a character.
